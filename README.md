# GraphPath 🚀 

GraphPath is a web-based application that allows users to **create graphs** and **find the shortest path** between nodes. It provides an intuitive interface for building graphs and leverages efficient algorithms to compute the shortest route.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📌 **Graph Creation** – Users can add, edit, and visualize nodes and edges.  
- 🔍 **Shortest Path Calculation** – Computes the optimal route between two nodes using algorithms like **Dijkstra’s** or **A* Search**.  
- 📊 **Graph Storage** – Saves graph data in a MySQL database for future use.  
- 🌐 **Interactive UI** – Built with JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL for smooth graph interactions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP, MySQL  
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s Algorithm
